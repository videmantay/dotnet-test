F-Zero Engineers

YOU are an engineer on the Blue Falcon racing team!  It is your job to test your racer so that it will be ready for racing against some of the world's best vehicles.

As an Engineer  it is your job to come up with tests that will ensure your get to the finish line first.

Software Development:
We need to create an app that will ensure that the engineers can keep track of their testing, give test instructions to the driver and record results.  There must also be a way of documenting anomalies called watch'ems  (watch items) and creating reports for when the anomalies persists then  move into Trite ( TRouble ITEms ) Category.


To begin you need to know what software you will be using :
Client side (or what is on the browser)
MDBootstrap(javascript library)
JSPdf (library for turning javascript into pdf)
There is the classic JQuery (javascript ) which is a dependencies that we will exploit as well.

Server Side:
We are building a ASP.NET site so we use C#
Our Database is SQL Server

We will start another wiki page to talk specific architecture but we will basically be following ASP.NET convention.
